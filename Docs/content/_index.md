## About MicroWin

**MicroWin** is a Windows system customization and optimization tool written in C#. It's a continuation and rewrite of the popular MicroWin project that was originally integrated into WinUtil. The tool allows advanced users to:

- **Debloat Windows** by removing store apps, features, and unnecessary software
- **Optimize system performance** through registry modifications and service management
- **Customize Windows** to suit specific needs and preferences
- **Create customized Windows images** using DISM and other system tools

The project is currently in **ALPHA** stages and designed for users with Windows systems administration knowledge. It requires administrator privileges to run and provides a GUI-based interface for managing complex system modifications on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

> [!WARNING]
> **DISCLAIMER:** Only use this project if you know what you're doing! If you don't have experience with Windows systems management, please do not use this software. It can make significant changes to your Windows installation.
